text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp; The league has combined both with Table 5 (Summary of Major Penalties) to give us one unified table with a handy grid:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49378\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"size-large wp-image-49378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scouting the Refs - NHL Rule Book 2025-26 - Table 5 - Major Penalties\" width=\"516\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=242%2C300&amp;ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scouting the Refs &#8211;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp; The league has combined both with Table 5 (Summary of Major Penalties) to give us one unified table with a handy grid:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49378\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"size-large wp-image-49378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scouting the Refs - NHL Rule Book 2025-26 - Table 5 - Major Penalties\" width=\"516\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=242%2C300&amp;ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scouting the Refs &#8211;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

Samuels-Thomas would work between the USHL and NAHL before getting the opportunity to work in the American Hockey League for the 2020-2021 season. Samuels-Thomas made his AHL officiating debut in a game between two of his former clubs &#8211; the San Diego Gulls and Ontario Reign.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the summer of 2021, following a successful season in the AHL, Jordan received the call from the National Hockey League to serve as a contracted minor league referee, completing yet another ‘full circle’ moment of the young officials career as he attended his first NHL officials training camp in Buffalo, New York &#8212;&nbsp; the same city where he attended his first NHL training camp as a prospect seven years before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Samuels-Thomas follows in the <a href=\"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2023/07/40457/scouting-the-refs-podcast-170-summer-school-with-jay-sharrers/\">footsteps of Jay Sharrers</a>, who became the NHL&#8217;s first black official in 1990 as a linesman, and later the league&#8217;s first black referee in 2001.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp; The league has combined both with Table 5 (Summary of Major Penalties) to give us one unified table with a handy grid:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49378\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"size-large wp-image-49378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scouting the Refs - NHL Rule Book 2025-26 - Table 5 - Major Penalties\" width=\"516\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=242%2C300&amp;ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scouting the Refs &#8211;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

</em><em>Text messages exchanged among Mr. Smith, Mr. Kimmel, and Mr. Walkom show that Mr. Rumble&#8217;s age was discussed as a point of concern; he was thirty-two years old at the time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble was invited to the NHL Exposure Combine (the Combine) but was told by Mr. Kimmel that he was getting started later in life than the NHL usually prefers. </em><em>Mr. Rumble then officiated at the NHL Rookie Tournament (the Rookie Tournament) in September of 2022 under the supervision of Chris Edwards, Scouting and Development Officiating Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Following the Rookie Tournament, Mr. Rumble was placed in the United States Hockey League (&#8220;USHL&#8221;), the NHL&#8217;s development league.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

</em><em>This led Mr. Rumble to call Mr. Edwards and Mr. Racicot to discuss the apparent age discrimination he was facing; Mr. Edwards stated that age discrimination is illegal and whoever told Mr. Rumble that he was too old, was incorrect.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

text-align: justify;\"><em>During the regular season, Mr. Rumble often officiated contentious games with playoff implications while also being paired with inexperienced referee partners; he was subsequently selected to work the 2024 Rookie Tournament.&nbsp; </em><em>Mr. Racicot told Mr. Rumble that the regular season games he was working were not by coincidence, and that he was being chosen to officiate important games with real implications because the NHL trusted his abilities.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble then worked the 2024-2025 regular season, and was cut after officiating two playoff games, which led Mr. Rumble to reach out to Mr. Racicot to ask if there was any information that he could share regarding his hiring prospects.&nbsp; </em><em>Mr. Racicot told Mr. Rumble that the NHL Officiating Managers all had concerns about his age; Mr. Rumble was thirty-five years old at the time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In June 2025, Mr. Rumble became aware that another referee had been hired by the NHL which led him to call Mr. Edwards. </em><em>On the phone call, Mr. Edwards stated that Mr. Rumble couldn&#8217;t have done anything different, other than maybe be five years younger.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp; The league has combined both with Table 5 (Summary of Major Penalties) to give us one unified table with a handy grid:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49378\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"size-large wp-image-49378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scouting the Refs - NHL Rule Book 2025-26 - Table 5 - Major Penalties\" width=\"516\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=242%2C300&amp;ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scouting the Refs &#8211;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

</em><em>Text messages exchanged among Mr. Smith, Mr. Kimmel, and Mr. Walkom show that Mr. Rumble&#8217;s age was discussed as a point of concern; he was thirty-two years old at the time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble was invited to the NHL Exposure Combine (the Combine) but was told by Mr. Kimmel that he was getting started later in life than the NHL usually prefers. </em><em>Mr. Rumble then officiated at the NHL Rookie Tournament (the Rookie Tournament) in September of 2022 under the supervision of Chris Edwards, Scouting and Development Officiating Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Following the Rookie Tournament, Mr. Rumble was placed in the United States Hockey League (&#8220;USHL&#8221;), the NHL&#8217;s development league.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble was excluded from the 2023-2024 playoffs and was told this was due to the fact it was his first season in the AHL. </em><em>However, another AHL first-year referee, Brody Sutter, was chosen for the playoffs, and Mr. Sutter is a year and a half younger than Mr. Rumble.&nbsp; </em><em>This led Mr. Rumble to call Mr. Edwards and Mr. Racicot to discuss the apparent age discrimination he was facing; Mr. Edwards stated that age discrimination is illegal and whoever told Mr. Rumble that he was too old, was incorrect.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>The response from Mr. Edwards contradicted Mr. Racicot, who told Mr. Rumble that he has one last kick at the can here, meaning the upcoming 2024-2025 season was his last chance to make it in the NHL because of his age.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble, having been discouraged, did not initially RSVP to the 2024 Combine but, after receiving a message from Mr. Edwards telling him to respond to the invitation, he did eventually commit to attending the Combine.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>&nbsp;In August 2024, at the Combine, Mr. Rumble performed at a high level.&nbsp; </em><em>During the weekend of the Combine, Mr. Walkom and Mr. Kimmel pulled Mr. Rumble aside to discuss his performance and noted their concerns with his age. </em><em>During this conversation, Mr. Kimmel reiterated that Mr. Rumble got started later in life than the NHL would prefer.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>During the regular season, Mr. Rumble often officiated contentious games with playoff implications while also being paired with inexperienced referee partners; he was subsequently selected to work the 2024 Rookie Tournament.&nbsp; </em><em>Mr. Racicot told Mr. Rumble that the regular season games he was working were not by coincidence, and that he was being chosen to officiate important games with real implications because the NHL trusted his abilities.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble then worked the 2024-2025 regular season, and was cut after officiating two playoff games, which led Mr. Rumble to reach out to Mr. Racicot to ask if there was any information that he could share regarding his hiring prospects.&nbsp; </em><em>Mr. Racicot told Mr. Rumble that the NHL Officiating Managers all had concerns about his age; Mr. Rumble was thirty-five years old at the time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In June 2025, Mr. Rumble became aware that another referee had been hired by the NHL which led him to call Mr. Edwards. </em><em>On the phone call, Mr. Edwards stated that Mr. Rumble couldn&#8217;t have done anything different, other than maybe be five years younger.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble also had a conversation with Mr. Kimmel, who stated that there was a logjam of older guys and the NHL needs fresh blood, some younger guys.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Mr. Kimmel told Mr. Rumble that there was nothing else he could have done, and this decision was made because he just didnt fit into [their] cycle.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger. He has a clear wish for this season: “Stay healthy, collect many great moments – and hopefully, in the end, look back on around 550 special games.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to David Nothegger on 500 ICE games!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linesman David Nothegger reached the 500-game mark on Friday when he stepped on the ice in his hometown of Salzburg to work a game in the ICE Hockey League</p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":49462,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"ICE Hockey League's David Nothegger Works 500th Game","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[25,1975],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-49459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-win2day-ice-hockey-league","et-has-post-format-content","et_post_format-et-post-format-standard"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-20-ICE-Nothegger-500-Games.png?fit=1203%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=49459"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49464,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/49459/revisions/49464"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/49462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=49459"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=49459"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=49459"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49416,"date":"2025-09-19T17:28:02","date_gmt":"2025-09-19T21:28:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/?p=49416"},"modified":"2025-09-20T09:05:21","modified_gmt":"2025-09-20T13:05:21","slug":"ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://scoutingtherefs.com/2025/09/49416/ahl-hires-yerkovich-to-head-up-officiating-player-safety/","title":{"rendered":"AHL Hires Yerkovich to Head Up Officiating, Player Safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Riley Yerkovich is movin&#8217; on up!&nbsp; The American Hockey League has hired Yerkovich as the league&#8217;s Director of Officiating and Player Safety.</p>\n<p>In his new role, Yerkovich will oversee the AHL&#8217;s on-ice officials and the league&#8217;s Player Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wyoming native spent the past three seasons in the ECHL, most recently as Director of Officiating Operations.&nbsp; Prior to moving upstairs, Yerkovich spent three seasons as an ECHL referee, where he handled the 2022 Kelly Cup Final as well as the 2022 ECHL All-Star Classic in Jacksonville.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp;

In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp; The league has combined both with Table 5 (Summary of Major Penalties) to give us one unified table with a handy grid:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49378\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"size-large wp-image-49378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scouting the Refs - NHL Rule Book 2025-26 - Table 5 - Major Penalties\" width=\"516\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=242%2C300&amp;ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scouting the Refs &#8211;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

text-align: justify;\">Nothegger has already stepped onto the ice 499 times as a linesman in the win2day ICE Hockey League. Now comes game number 500. “This game is connected with many emotions for me – above all, pride in what I’ve accomplished and gratitude for the experiences I was allowed to gather over all these years. I want to especially thank my family and friends, who have supported me for so long,” says the native of Pinzgau.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothing changes in his preparation for Friday: “The game itself is like any other. On the ice, it’s about the game – the referee should not be in the spotlight.” And yet, he admits it is a special moment: “Several family members, friends, and also colleagues will be in the arena. At such an anniversary, you automatically reflect on everything you’ve experienced. Reaching this number of games was always one of my goals. I’ve had the privilege to work side by side with many colleagues – some of whom have become good friends over the years.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">Nothegger officiated his very first league game on January 1, 2012, in Villach – a moment he remembers not only because it was his debut. In the second period, he crashed into the boards, dislocated his shoulder, and had to be taken to the hospital. “I remember that very clearly. Fortunately, there have also been plenty of positive highlights – such as intense playoff battles or finals. I also remember games where I didn’t perform at my best and rightfully faced criticism. That helped me grow in my development.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">In the current season, the Pinzgau native – who officiated at the 2023 World Championship in Tampere (FIN) and Riga (LAT) – has already been on duty during the preseason as well as in Champions Hockey League games. On Friday, he will now make his 2025/26 league season debut. “The preparation games and the CHL already went really well. Now I’m looking forward to the upcoming tasks in the win2day ICE Hockey League,” says Nothegger.

This applies to any situation or rule that isn’t explicitly covered in the rule literature.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Managers Have Been Eliminated</strong> (Rules 21.2, 27.3)</h2>\n<p>References to a &#8216;manager or coach&#8217; have been simplified to just the coach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Awarded Goals to Fouled Players </strong>(In-Arena Official Scorer, Rule 33.2)&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><em>&#8220;When an attacking player is about to get to a loose puck and is fouled preventing a shot at the open net, resulting in an awarded goal, the fouled player shall be given credit for the goal.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>In the past, goals have been awarded to the last player to touch the puck. Now, the guy who would&#8217;ve scored gets the goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Coach&#8217;s Challenges for Delaying The Game &#8211; Puck Over Glass</strong>&nbsp;(Rule 38.12)</h2>\n<p>Reworded to be less prescriptive.&nbsp; Formerly, the rule called for the Situation Room to determine that the puck &#8220;was deflected <em>or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; The 2025-26 edition only requires that the puck <em>&#8220;was deflected.&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;From a practical standpoint, we&#8217;re not expecting any actual change to the interpretation here.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nInterference</strong> (Rule 56)</h2>\n<p>The prior version of the rulebook required that <em>&#8220;a minor penalty for interference <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shall</span> </strong>be imposed&#8230;&#8221;</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The updated edition softens it, merely saying that a minor penalty <em>&#8220;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can</span> </strong>be imposed&#8221;</em> in the same situations.&nbsp; Apparently, the league is codifying the fact that this is a judgment call, and not every incident should result in a penalty.</p>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHigh-Sticking</strong> (Rule 60)</h2>\n<p>The NHL has ever-so-slightly changed the definition of what is considered a high stick.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Previously:&nbsp; &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which is <strong>carried above the height of the opponent&#8217;s shoulders</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>New: &#8220;<em>A &#8216;high stick&#8217; is one which <strong>contacts an opponent above the shoulders, provided their shoulders are at waist level or higher</strong>.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That change cascades into some of the additional high-sticking rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 60.3 for a double-minor:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;carries or holds any part of his stick above the shoulders and makes contact with his opponent’s neck, face or head&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;makes contact with his stick on an opponent’s neck, face or head (above the height of the opponent’s waist)&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no change to the injury requirement for a high-sticking double-minor call.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rule 60.4 for a match penalty similarly simplifies the rule based on the updated terminology.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>2024-25: <em>&#8220;while carrying or holding any part of his stick above the shoulders of the opponent,&#8221;</em></li>\n<li>2025-26: <em>&#8220;with a high-stick.&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><br />\nHand Pass</strong> (Rule 79)</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a clarification!&nbsp; In apparent response to outcries on hand pass calls in the past, an additional detail was added to the rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;If, in the opinion of the on-ice officials, the puck has deflected off a player’s hand, and no advantage has been gained by the team, it will not constitute a violation for the purpose of this rule.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Offside</strong> (Rule 83)</h2>\n<p>Additional detail was given around the definition of a skate relative to an offside call, with the following sentence added to the existing rule:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;For the purposes of this rule, a &#8216;skate&#8217; is to be considered the blade of the skate only.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Not sure that we had any issues where to boot or laces were a determining factor, but at least we know precisely what the league is looking at.&nbsp; This could also be a precursor to technological updates for offside calls, assuming that any automated systems will be using the skate blades as their reference points when evaulating an offside play.</p>\n<p>The league also clarified the portion of the rule about possession and control on the entry.&nbsp; Where, previously, Rule 83.1 required that a player have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck&#8221;</em> when crossing the blue line, the updated rule specifies that a player must have <em>&#8220;possession and control of the puck <strong>with his stick prior to both skates completely crossing the leading edge</strong> of the blue line.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>That might wipe out the handful of situations where a player was deemed onside after kicking the puck ahead but prior to actually playing it with his stick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Major Penalties Tables Combined</strong></h2>\n<p>Previous versions of the NHL Rule Book had separate tables for Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct (Table 6) and Major Penalties that Result in an Automatic Game Misconduct When There is an Injury to the Face or Head (Table 7).&nbsp; The league has combined both with Table 5 (Summary of Major Penalties) to give us one unified table with a handy grid:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_49378\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"size-large wp-image-49378\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scouting the Refs - NHL Rule Book 2025-26 - Table 5 - Major Penalties\" width=\"516\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=516%2C640&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?resize=242%2C300&amp;ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/scoutingtherefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-NHL-Rule-Book-2025-26-Table-5-Major-Penalties.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-49378\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scouting the Refs &#8211;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Jackson grew up in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he began skating at a young age. His older brother played hockey and his father was an NHL referee at the time. Jackson played hockey throughout his high school days and eventually earned a scholarship to play at Pomfret School, a prep school in CT. After Pomfret, he played two years of junior hockey in Portland, ME and Hawkesbury, Ontario.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In 2016, Jackson attended the NHL Exposure Combine where he got his feet wet and was exposed to the world of officiating outside of what he experienced through his dad’s career. Jackson became a freshman at Manhattanville College soon after, where he played NCAA hockey for 4 years and captained his team during his Junior and Senior seasons. In 2020, Jackson graduated from Manhattanville while the Covid pandemic first reached the United States. Once his senior season ended, he landed a spot playing for the Fayetteville Marksmen in the SPHL for the remainder of their 2019-2020 season. The winter of 2020 rolled around and Jackson signed a contract with the Maine Mariners in the ECHL for the 2020-2021 season, however the team opted out of that season last minute due to the ongoing pandemic. Jackson found a spot on the Birmingham Bulls later that season as the SPHL was still operating with 5 teams.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>After the 2021 season, Jackson realized that his playing days were numbered, and made a commitment to officiating. He attended the 2021 NHL Exposure Combine once again, where he landed a job as a linesman in the AHL for the following season. After the 2021-2022 AHL season came to a close, Jackson was hired to a minor leagues contract by the NHL during that offseason.</em></p>\n<p>Congratulations to linesperson Ryan Jackson on his full-time promotion.

</em><em>Text messages exchanged among Mr. Smith, Mr. Kimmel, and Mr. Walkom show that Mr. Rumble&#8217;s age was discussed as a point of concern; he was thirty-two years old at the time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble was invited to the NHL Exposure Combine (the Combine) but was told by Mr. Kimmel that he was getting started later in life than the NHL usually prefers. </em><em>Mr. Rumble then officiated at the NHL Rookie Tournament (the Rookie Tournament) in September of 2022 under the supervision of Chris Edwards, Scouting and Development Officiating Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Following the Rookie Tournament, Mr. Rumble was placed in the United States Hockey League (&#8220;USHL&#8221;), the NHL&#8217;s development league.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble was excluded from the 2023-2024 playoffs and was told this was due to the fact it was his first season in the AHL. </em><em>However, another AHL first-year referee, Brody Sutter, was chosen for the playoffs, and Mr. Sutter is a year and a half younger than Mr. Rumble.&nbsp; </em><em>This led Mr. Rumble to call Mr. Edwards and Mr. Racicot to discuss the apparent age discrimination he was facing; Mr. Edwards stated that age discrimination is illegal and whoever told Mr. Rumble that he was too old, was incorrect.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;

text-align: justify;\"><em>&nbsp;In August 2024, at the Combine, Mr. Rumble performed at a high level.&nbsp; </em><em>During the weekend of the Combine, Mr. Walkom and Mr. Kimmel pulled Mr. Rumble aside to discuss his performance and noted their concerns with his age. </em><em>During this conversation, Mr. Kimmel reiterated that Mr. Rumble got started later in life than the NHL would prefer.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>During the regular season, Mr. Rumble often officiated contentious games with playoff implications while also being paired with inexperienced referee partners; he was subsequently selected to work the 2024 Rookie Tournament.&nbsp; </em><em>Mr. Racicot told Mr. Rumble that the regular season games he was working were not by coincidence, and that he was being chosen to officiate important games with real implications because the NHL trusted his abilities.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>Mr. Rumble then worked the 2024-2025 regular season, and was cut after officiating two playoff games, which led Mr. Rumble to reach out to Mr. Racicot to ask if there was any information that he could share regarding his hiring prospects.&nbsp; </em><em>Mr. Racicot told Mr. Rumble that the NHL Officiating Managers all had concerns about his age; Mr. Rumble was thirty-five years old at the time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><em>In June 2025, Mr. Rumble became aware that another referee had been hired by the NHL which led him to call Mr. Edwards. </em><em>On the phone call, Mr. Edwards stated that Mr. Rumble couldn&#8217;t have done anything different, other than maybe be five years younger.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;
